# Development Notes
- Running on WSL2, Ubuntu-22.40 and Docker
- On WSL2 Terminal, rqt works as intended but inside container no go
- Trying to install VcXsrv and set it up first
- set .wslconfig to have mirrored network
- dyn_obstacles.launch.py spawns multiple obstacles, can refer to it to see how we might spawn more than 1 agent. Note robot_state_publisher and spawn_entity
- if installing new stuff try to put at the end of docker file for the cache to speed up build
- for base dynus launch, need to source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.bash
- as of this line, this repo/docker combination works out of the box. after starting the container with `make run-sim`, run the single agent in forest via `bash ./dynus.sh`
- to see ros2 topics, `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID = 7`, making all panes/terminals the same
- fake_sim is the node that moves the drone! updated state is published every 10ms. how the state is updated is very simplistic in fake_sim, here the new state and velocity is taken to be that of the set point and orientation is a function of setpoint acceleration.
- timesynced node/subscriber that listens on state, goal. but the next state and current state exist on the same topic! next state is computed from goal i.e. next state is a function of goal
- `ros2 run dynus flight_data_collector_single.py --ros-args -r __ns:=/NX01`
- for now, just pull dynus in container and rebuild before deving directly in container. abit cursed but ya.
- need to think about reference control input. 
- attaching volume to container with write permissions to collect data
- as of this line, can run easy_forest with either `dynus.sh` or `tmuxp`
- multiagent not running atm, likely due to some memory thing, should try next work day. the fix `--ipc=host` apparently is not secure but yet to try. alternative is `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm`
